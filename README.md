# Azure-Resource_Monitoring
This project demonstrates the configuration of a secure virtual network environment on Microsoft Azure, designed to allow only HTTPS traffic and provide comprehensive monitoring and alerting. The goal was to create a robust, secure setup while implementing key skills from the AZ-104 certification.

Project Overview
Objective: Deploy a secure Azure Virtual Network and Virtual Machine with enforced HTTPS access, storage monitoring, and alert configurations.
Technologies: Azure Virtual Network (VNet), Network Security Groups (NSG), Virtual Machines (VM), Storage Account, Azure Monitor, and Alert Rules.
Outcome: A fully monitored virtual network and VM, with alert rules and diagnostic settings to proactively manage and secure the environment.
Deployment Steps
1. Set up the Virtual Network and Network Security Group
Create a Virtual Network (VNet) in your resource group.
Add a Network Security Group (NSG) to allow only HTTPS traffic:
Configure an Inbound Rule for port 443 (HTTPS).
Add a Deny All rule for other traffic.
2. Deploy a Virtual Machine and Configure Monitoring
Deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) within the VNet.
Enable Monitoring and Insights on the VM.
Configure alerts for:
CPU Utilization: Alert when usage exceeds a threshold (e.g., 80%).
VM Avaliability: Alert when the Avaliability for the VM is down.
3. Configure Storage Account with Diagnostic Logging
Create a Storage Account within the resource group.
Enable Monitoring and Diagnostics:
Track metrics like total storage used and transactions.
Configure alert rules to notify on anomalies or specific thresholds.
4. Testing the Alerts
CPU Alert: Simulate high CPU usage to trigger the alert via powershell.
Storage Alert: Adjust storage account usage to test alert rules.
